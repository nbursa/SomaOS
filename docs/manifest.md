# The SomaOS Manifest

_By Nenad Bursać_

---

## 1. A Human-Centered Revolution

The screen is no longer central. The voice is no longer enough. The hand is no longer required.

We interact not through clicks, taps or commands—  
but through **attention** and **intention**.

SomaOS is not a gadget.  
It is **a new interface layer for the human mind**.

---

## 2. Private by Design

Your thoughts are yours.

SomaOS never records, never sends, never interprets _what_ you think—  
only _that_ you meant to act.

All processing is local.  
All signals are biometric and encrypted.  
You are not observed. You are assisted.

---

## 3. Minimal Visual, Maximal Meaning

The world is visual. The interface should not be.

SomaOS does not add clutter—it **subtracts friction**.  
It displays symbols, status, and context—never paragraphs, menus, or distractions.

You do not browse. You do not scan.  
You focus. It responds.

---

## 4. Sound Without Sound

Voice is invasive.  
SomaOS speaks in silence.

Using **bone-conduction audio**, it whispers only to you.  
Articles are read aloud or summarized. Prompts are offered. Feedback is felt.

No one else hears it. No one else knows.

---

## 5. Thought OS (Intention-Driven Flow)

You do not select from a list.  
You don’t choose from a menu.  
You look. You think. It acts.

Each state presents **one optimal action**.  
You approve or reject it by thought.  
This is not UX. This is **cognitive choreography**.

---

## 6. The Dock as Mind Anchor

SomaOS gains full capability when near a trusted zone.

The **Dock Node** provides:

- local AI inference  
- context recall  
- memory access  
- safe state changes

This is **not cloud computing**. This is _trusted cognition range_.

---

## 7. Stratified Modes of Interaction

SomaOS adapts:

- In motion: passive ambient layer only  
- In rest: minimal suggestions, symbolic interface  
- At home/work: full cognitive system activation

You are never overwhelmed.  
The system adjusts to _your state_, not the other way around.

---

## 8. You Are the Interface

You don’t use SomaOS.

**You are SomaOS.**

It becomes your intuition.  
It responds to your focus.  
It knows without invading.  
It acts without distraction.

It disappears.

---

## 9. This Is The Last Interface

No more screens. No more searching. No more choosing.  
This is the first OS built for **thought**, **awareness**, and **intimacy**.

Not an upgrade.  
A new beginning.

---

## 10. This Is Not Open. This Is Singular

SomaOS is not an open protocol.  
It is not a collaborative platform.  
It is a singular vision of a post-interface reality.

You may inquire.  
But you may not copy.

This system is protected, authored, and directed with intent.

All components—technical, conceptual, linguistic, and architectural—are covered by full intellectual property rights.

Use, adaptation, or commercial reproduction is prohibited without written consent.

This is not a product.  
It is the next paradigm of human–machine symbiosis.

---

## 11. Investment Inquiries

SomaOS is an original, integrated concept ready for technical realization.
