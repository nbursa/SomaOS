# Soma OS ‚Äì The Thought Interface

**Soma** is a new kind of operating system.

It has no screen.  
It has no keyboard.  
It has no voice input.  
It listens to your thoughts.  
And it speaks only to you.

Soma is a private, symbol-driven, thought-controlled interface built for the real world.

> **You don‚Äôt click. You intend.**

## What is Soma?

- A minimal AR visual layer (symbols, status, context)  
- Bone-conduction audio feedback (silent, private voice)  
- EEG-based intent detection (calibrated per user)  
- Local-only processing ‚Äî no cloud, no surveillance  
- Dock-enhanced full functionality when in trusted zones

---

## Why?

Smartphones are unnatural.  
Voice assistants are invasive.  
Screens are addictive.  
Soma is none of these.

Soma is your inner interface ‚Äî projected outward.

## Vision & Architecture

Soma is not an app.  
It is a fully integrated cognitive interface platform.

See:

- [`manifest.md`](./docs/manifest.md) ‚Äî Core vision and principles  
- [`spec.md`](./docs/spec.md) ‚Äî Technical system design (v0.1)
